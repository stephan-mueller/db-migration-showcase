This is a showcase to demonstrate database migration with [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) and [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org). 
Software requirements to run the samples are `maven`, `openjdk-8` (or any other JDK 8) and `docker`.

The [flyway-showcase](flyway-showcase/README.md) shows how to migrate a database with Flyway manually and automatically during application startup.

The [liquibase-showcase](liquibase-showcase/README.md) shows how to migrate a database with Liquibase manually and automatically during application startup.
